Arduino code for a wireless soil moisture sensor

The transmitter code (solarSensorTx) is intended for an ATTiny85 running inside the garden light.

Two example reciever sketches are included:
solarSensorRxLCD prints readings to a 20x4 LCD (and serial)
solarSensorRxRTC uses a DS3232 clock and prints timestamped CSV data over serial (for later analysis)
